#### Overview My project will soon be available for users to enjoy! It's currently in a staging phase where I and my friends can test it, simulating a low-level production environment. 

#### Details 
- **Frontend:** Deployed via S3 and CloudFront as a React App in AWS.
- **Backend:** Hosted on an EC2 Express server.
- **Database:** Connected to MongoDB and using Mongoose as my ODM.
- **Caching:** Using Redis to cache data and reduce DB calls.
- **API:** Blizzard API & RaiderIO API
- **API Management:** Implemented API throttling to stay within Blizzard's API terms of use.
- **Automated Pipeline:** Implmented a pipeline with Github Actions to automate deployments from the dev to staging branches.

#### Technologies 
- **Frontend:** React, AWS S3, AWS CloudFront, AWS Cognito
- **Backend:** Express, AWS EC2
- **Database:** MongoDB, Redis
- **APIs:** Blizzard API & RaiderIO API

#### Current Status: While the staging application isn't perfect, it's designed for testing purposes to simulate a real production atmosphere.
