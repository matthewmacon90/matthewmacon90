-My project will be in production for users to use in the near future. 
Details: The frontend is served through s3 and cloudfront as a React App in AWS while the backend is Ec2 Express server that is connected to both the Blizzard api and mongodb for the database. Additionally, I am using Redis to cache data and reduce the amount of calls to the DB. I've also implemented API throttling to stay within bounds of Blizzard's API terms of use service. 
The staging application does is imperfect, but it is meant for me to test, my friends to test, and provide an enviorment to simulate a low-level production atmosphere.
